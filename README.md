#### - Project Status: [In Progress]


# Description

The idea for the project came as a response to the problem of finding a fitting place to call "home". Everyone has their own needs, desires, budgets and way of approaching the subject of buying a new home. Knowing how challenging it can be at times, we wanted to do our best to find a way to make the lives of those looking for somewhere to move at least a little bit easier. The project finds the current available offers and notifies the customers on those who meet the specified criteria such as the city, price, number of rooms etc. In order for someone to start getting notifications they would have to send a mail containing basic information so that later, the application would have enough information in order to start searching.

We use 2 robots, one for sending mails, and one for subscribing users to this service. For managing these robots we used the orchestrator platform.
